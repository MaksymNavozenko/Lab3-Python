In the world of modern technology, we are increasingly dependent on devices,
that make our lives more convenient and efficient.
Smartphones, tablets, computers and other gadgets have become an integral part of our everyday life.
They help us stay connected, work, learn,
rest and even maintain health.
With the development of artificial intelligence and automation technologies, we can solve complex tasks faster and more accurately,
than ever before. However, the growing role of technologies requires a careful approach to their use.
It is important to understand both the positive and potentially negative effects of digital tools on our lives.
The task of each of us is to use technologies so that they serve for the good, help to develop,
but they did not stand in the way of lively communication and personal development.
